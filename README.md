# :blue_book: mkit-bundle-storybook

> Micro Storybook project bundle

_Slightly opinionated_ [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) starter template supporting various best practices.

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and its [Addons](https://storybook.js.org/addons/introduction/) provide UI development environment and playground for components. However, there are some essential practices and addons we identify as a must-have for every project. Actions, Knobs, Notes, Viewport, (es)lint, pre-commit hooks... **Say No More!**

**Bug reports and PRs are more than welcome!**

## Motivation

This project strives to deliver clean folder structure and satisfying development experience. **Easy.**

**Zero configuration.** Everything is set for you to `start writing your own code` (standalone library) of components supported by Storybook.

There are many Storybook projects out there, but we felt there should be a template to get you started at a fairly opinionated level. **Best practices** and coding tools at your disposal.

**This boilerplate will get you exactly to the point where you can start your own journey. Build your own Storybook-based components library.**

### Folder Structure

```bash

## Available Scripts

From the root directory, you can run:

```bash
# Development
$ yarn storybook

# Build static website ready for deployment
$ yarn storybook:build

# Run tests with coverage report
$ yarn test

# Run tests in `--watch` mode
$ yarn test:watch

# Build
$ yarn build

# Release and publish
$ yarn release
```

## Tests

Existing testing is done via Jest Snapshots, a.k.a. [Structural testing](https://storybook.js.org/testing/structural-testing/).

Creating a test file under `/tests` and using [StoryShots](https://storybook.js.org/testing/structural-testing/#using-storyshots) will automatically instruct Jest to create snapshots of your components and all their variants.

If your components change, snapshots will not match and you have to either fix your code or update the snapshots.

## Publishing

When you are ready to publish your package there is a handful command to help you - `release`.

```bash
$ yarn release
```

`release` executes multiple script commands in the following order:

1. `npm test` - Run tests and report coverage
2. `npm run build` - Build the `/src` code using Babel
3. `npm release-it` - Automated commit, `semver`, tagging, publishing to `npm`, [and more](https://www.npmjs.com/package/release-it)
